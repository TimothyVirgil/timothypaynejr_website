        <h2>Life</h2>
        <br>&emsp; My life currently:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>I work at DuPont as a "Data Engineer". I'm really more of a
                "Data Software Engineer".
            </li>
            <br><li>I'm planning to take Microsoft Azure's DP-203 "Data Engineering on Azure" exam soon.
                As my job title is "Data Engineer" I'd like to be able to claim I actually know what I'm doing.
            </li><br>
            <li>I don't think I want to be an actual data engineer in the future. I think I'm more into software
                engineering or perhaps devops engineering. Maybe AI engineering too but I've lost a little hype for the
                large language models.</li><br>
            <li>My daughter just turned one and my son is three.</li><br>
            <li>My current hobbies include video games, TV, and learning Japanese. (I know almost 500 kanji now)</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        &emsp; That's my life currently.
